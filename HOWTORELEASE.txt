This document describes the process for releasing a new version of libLAS.

General Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The libLAS library is very conservative with regards to API linkages. 
Specifically, major versions (1.0, 2.0, ..., X.0) of the library should be 
released if the C API changes in any significant way, especially if you are 
removing or changing API functions.  It is desirable that minor versions 
(1.1, 1.2, ..., 1.X) of the library are API compatible for the C++ APIs, 
but this is not required.

Release Process

1) Increment Version Numbers
 
  - configure.ac
  - nmake.opt
  - include/liblas/capi/las_config.h

2) Update README to include any relevant info about the release that 
   might have changed.

3) Build Windows version

  - Issue nmake and nmake install commands
  
  ::
      
      nmake /f makefile.vc clean
      nmake /f makefile.vc
      nmake /f makefile.vc install

  - Build Python bindings for Python 2.4 and Python 2.5 
  
  ::
      
      python setup.py bdist_wininst
      python setup.py bdist_egg
 
  - Upload Python bindings to PyPI
  
  ::
      
      # ensure a .pypirc file exists here with login info
      set HOME=C:\Docume~1\hobu.FIRE-WINDOWS
      c:\python24\python.exe setup.py sdist upload
      c:\python24\python.exe setup.py bdist_wininst upload
      c:\python24\python.exe setup.py bdist_egg upload
      c:\python25\python.exe setup.py bdist_egg upload
      
  - Create a zip file from the .\bin directory.  This will contain the 
    utilities and relevant DLLs.  The Python bindings are packaged with their 
    own copies of the DLLs.  I usually call this file liblas$(VERSION).zip.
    

4) Make the source distribution

  ::
      
      make dist

5) Only bz2 files can be uploaded to trac, so gunzip the dist file and 
   recompress it as bz2.

       
6) Generate MD5 sums 

  ::
      
      md5 las-0.9.7.tar.bz2
      md5 liblas0.9.7.zip

6) Create a new release page on http://liblas.org/wiki/Releases

7) Upload windows and source package as attachments to the new release page.

8) Tag the release

  ::
      
      svn cp http://liblas.org/svn/trunk http://liblas.org/svn/tags/0.9.7

9) Write the release notes.  Place a copy of the release notes on the release 
   page you created as well as send an email to liblas-devel announcing the 
   new release.
